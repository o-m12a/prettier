#### Prevent extra whitespace outside single interpolation in Angular (#17426 by @o-m12a)

Detect Angular elements wrapping only single interpolation, and handle them as whitespace-sensitive.

This improvement is for avoiding unintentional extra whitespaces.  
The unintentional extra whitespaces were obstacles for readability or understandability within unit tests, when checking the textContent of the element.

Under `printWidth: 10`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<!-- Input -->
<h1>{{ foo }}</h1>

<!-- Prettier stable -->
<h1>
  {{
    foo
  }}
</h1>

<!-- Prettier main -->
<h1>{{
  foo
}}</h1>
```
